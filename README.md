## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information. New contributors should read this first.

The most important document you should read afterwards is [docs/plugins/StatefulMenu.md](./docs/plugins/StatefulMenu.md). This is the central pillar of this project, and a good understanding of it is essential to contributing.
